Description: A custom WordPress theme built from a static HTML design by uCertify. | About Me: Hi, I’m Aaquib Ahmed, a Senior Web Application Developer with over five years of experience. I enjoy building robust and scalable digital solutions that make a difference. I’ve been fortunate to work with modern programming languages and technologies, which I use to create seamless user experiences and reliable applications. My focus is on front-end and back-end development, database optimization, and responsive design—I try my best to pay attention to the details while keeping up with the latest trends. I love turning ideas into reality and feel grateful for the trust others have placed in me as a dependable developer. | Social Media: LinkedIn [https://linkedin.com/in/aaquib-ahmed], Facebook [https://facebook.com/aaquib], Instagram [https://instagram.com/aaquib], WhatsApp [https://wa.me/1234567890], Website [https://www.ucertify.com/]
